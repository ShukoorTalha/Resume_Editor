## Getting Started

### One-command start for non-technical users

If Docker is already installed, the simplest way to run the app locally is:

```bash
./quick-start.sh
```

If the file is not executable yet, run this once first:

```bash
chmod +x quick-start.sh
```

The script starts the local Docker Compose stack and opens on port `8081`.

### Run locally with Docker

If you just want the app running on your own machine, use the standard Compose file or the quick start script:

```bash
docker compose up -d
# or
./quick-start.sh
```

Then open:

```bash
http://localhost:8081
```

To stop it later:

```bash
docker compose down
```

This path is self-contained and does not require `npm install` during the Docker build.

### Option 1: Run with Docker (Recommended)

If you have Docker installed, you can get up and running in seconds.

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShukoorTalha/Resume_Editor.git
   cd Resume_Editor
   ```

2. **Start the app:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

  If you run it manually with `docker run`, include restart support:

  ```bash
  docker run -d --restart unless-stopped -p 8081:80 resume-builder:latest
  ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8081`

### Option 2: Run with Node.js

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open the link provided in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:3000`)

### Option 3: Build for Production

To generate static files for deployment (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel):

```bash
npm run build
```

The output will be in the `dist/` folder.

## Technologies Used

- **React 18** - UI library
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework (via CDN)
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and dev server
- **Lucide React** - Icon library
- **html2pdf.js** - PDF export functionality
- **Docker** - Containerization

## Development Tips

### Customizing Colors

Edit the Tailwind theme in `index.html`:

```javascript
tailwind.config = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: '#2563eb',    // Change primary color
        secondary: '#475569',  // Change secondary color
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Adding New Sections

1. Create a new component in `components/` (e.g., `CertificationsSection.tsx`)
2. Add the data type to `types.ts`
3. Import and integrate in `ResumeEditor.tsx`
4. Update `ResumePreview.tsx` to display the new section

### Building Docker Image Locally

```bash
docker build -t resume-builder:latest .
docker run -p 8080:80 resume-builder:latest
```
