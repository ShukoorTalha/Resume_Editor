---

## 🎯 Quick Start (Recommended)

The absolute fastest way to get everything running:

```bash
cd /Users/shukoortalha/Resume_Builder/Resume_Editor
./quick-start.sh
```

**That's it!** In 5 minutes you'll have:
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Docker image built
- ✅ Services running

## ⚙️ System Requirements

Before running any script, ensure you have:

- **Node.js 18+**
  ```bash
  node --version
  ```

- **npm**
  ```bash
  npm --version
  ```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
```bash
# Find what's using the port
lsof -i :8080    # Jenkins
lsof -i :9090    # Prometheus
lsof -i :3000    # Grafana

# Kill the process or stop the service
```

### Docker Daemon Not Running
```bash
# macOS
open -a Docker

# Linux
sudo systemctl start docker
```

### Tests Failing
```bash
# Run with details
npm run test -- --reporter=verbose

# Check for syntax errors
npm run type-check
```

### Jenkins Won't Start
```bash
# Check logs
docker logs jenkins

# Ensure port 8080 is free
lsof -i :8080

# Remove container if stuck
docker rm jenkins
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Re-run Scripts
Scripts are idempotent (safe to run multiple times):
```bash
./quick-start.sh  # Safe to run again
```

### Clean Up Between Runs
```bash
# Stop services
docker stop jenkins
docker-compose -f docker-compose.monitoring.yml down

# Clean Docker
docker system prune -f
```

### View Script Source
All scripts are readable and well-commented:
```bash
cat quick-start.sh
cat setup-full-automation.sh
cat test-automation.sh
```

### Integrate with Git Hooks
```bash
# Add to .git/hooks/pre-commit
#!/bin/bash
./test-automation.sh
```
